## Key Principles

- **Strict separation:** Demos, audits, and public modules are open; core business and confidential assets remain private and local only.
- **Transparency:** Performance, audit, and demo material is available for community review and credibility.
- **Branding & communication:** Centralized assets, up-to-date docs, clear folders for each audience (dev, client, partner, recruiter, contributor).
- **Security & confidentiality:** Strong .gitignore, no confidential or proprietary data in public folders, explicit privacy statements in each critical folder.
- **Contributor experience:** Easy onboarding thanks to clear docs, safe examples, community, and issue/PR templates.
